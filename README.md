# OpenAI Chatbot
 A Python-based implementation of a chatbot based on OpenAI's ChatCompletion models.

## Current Limitations

 Currently, I don't have any sort of progress indicator in operation to show when the response is being generated. You simply click "Submit" and wait for a response. 

 Streaming is not supported over OpenAI API call via Python.
